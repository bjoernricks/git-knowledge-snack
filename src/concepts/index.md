# Git Concepts

Git is a [**Distributed Version Control System**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distributed_version_control).

A **version control system** saves the state of current source files.

Every state is saved in a snapshot, the so called **commit**.

The commits form a [**directed acyclic graph**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Directed_acyclic_graph).

Every git object is referenced by a **hashsum**, a SHA1 hash.
