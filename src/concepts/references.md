# Git References

For not having to remember git hashes for addressing specific commits, it would
be easier to to link a commit to a simple name so you could use that simple name
rather than the SHA-1 value.

In Git, these names are called *references* or *refs*.

Most important references are:

```{toctree}
refs-tags
refs-branches
refs-remotes
refs-head
```
