# Git References

As shown every git object is identified by a SHA-1 hash. For not having to
remember git hashes for addressing specific commits, it would be easier if you
had a file in which you could store that SHA-1 value under a simple name so you
could use that simple name rather than the raw SHA-1 value.

In Git, these names are called *references* or *refs*.

Most important references are:

* tags
* branches
* HEAD

## Tags
