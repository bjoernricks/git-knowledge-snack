# HEAD

The HEAD is a special dynamic reference pointing to the branch youâ€™re currently
working on. It can be used when the latest checked out commit has to be
referenced.

    branch BranchA
    checkout BranchA
    commit
    commit
    checkout main
    merge BranchA id: "HEAD"
```

Most git commands default to `HEAD` if no reference or hash is passed as an argument.

For example:

```
git show --stat HEAD
# is the same as
git show --stat
```
